|  | [300A Bus Bar 12v Power Distribution Block](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCNTJTQL) | Since space was a concern, these allowed for wiring components to the sides of the case instead of on top of a battery. I can also take the batteries in an out without having to unhook everything. |

|  | [Kohree 12"x18" 12V/13.5V RV Water Tank Heating Pad](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJ8PQ4DV) | For heating up the batteries in case the temperature drops too low. Some batteries have built in heating functions but cost more and add to the size. |

|  | [RIDGID Modular Tool Box (optional)](https://www.homedepot.com/p/320483663) | Optional storage that stacks and locks onto the main case. I have other emergency supplies in it, and can wheel the whole thing around. |
|  | [20A 12 AWG 8-Outlet Metal Power Strip Surge Protector 6ft (optional)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3KVH6RR) | Heavy duty power strip that you can plug multiple items into. Just keep in mind that the outlets are standard household 15A and can only deliver so much power before tripping a circuit. |
|  | [Yellow Jacket 50ft 10AWG 20A Extension Cord (optional)](https://www.homedepot.com/p/204667727) | This'll save you from lugging the generator around. This combined with the power strip should give you power a good distance away. |
